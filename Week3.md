# Week 3

Welcome to the **Week 3** of **Controls Theory Bootcamp** organized by the **Electronics and Robotics Club**.

This week we will learn about:
*	Control Systems - their basic components, types and features
*	Mathematical modelling of control systems - Differential equations and Transfer functions
*	Stability and Controllability
*	Introduction to PID Control

The following topics will be covered-

*	Introduction to MATLAB
  1. creating matrices and functions <br>
  2.	solving ODEs <br>
  3.	plotting graphs <br>
  4.	creating graphics
* Introduction to Simulink
  *	Some fundamental mathematical blocks <br>
  *	Modelling systems with block diagrams
*	Analysing a physical system using the concepts of Control Theory
  * Make a beautiful simulation of the system using MATLAB graphics <br>
  * Create a block diagram of the physical system in Simulink and look at its behaviour
