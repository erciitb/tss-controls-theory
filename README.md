# Technical Summer School 2021 - Controls Theory

Given the growing importance of controls theory in various engineering fields, it becomes essential to have its fundamentals clear. By the end of the course, you will be versed with the basics of Control theory and its vivid applications, the use of software such as MATLAB and Simulink for modelling and simulating systems like a PID Controller and Inverted Pendulum, solving interesting engineering problem statements, etc.

The relevant week-wise resources would be provided on the ERC Github page. Intriguing Midterm and Endterm assignments will be given which will focus on the application part of concepts covered. Doubt sessions would be conducted on demand. The workshop will be followed by an expertâ€™s talk, to get you familiarized with the real-life implementation of controls theory in the ongoing world.

### Start Date
4th July 2021

### Duration
6 - 7 hours/week for 4 weeks (including assignments)

### Timeline
- Week 1: Introduction to Control systems and general mathematics. Introduction to PID control.
- Week 2: Very basic python and learning about PID tuning by simulating a PID-based Line Follower using stub code provided using the pygame library.
- Week 3: Introduction to MATLAB and Simulink, with a focus on the key functions required for implementing a controls system. Introduction to the problem statement of an inverted pendulum.
- Week 4: Working on the final assignment. 

### Course Completion
All the assignments must be solved and submitted. These assignments would then be graded, and certificates would be awarded based on the performance.
