# Technical Summer School 2021 - Controls Theory

Given the growing importance of controls theory in various engineering fields, it becomes essential to have its fundamentals clear. By the end of the course, you will be versed with the basics of Control theory and its vivid applications, the use of software such as MATLAB and Simulink for modelling and simulating systems like a PID Controller and Inverted Pendulum, solving interesting engineering problem statements, etc.

The relevant week-wise resources would be provided on the ERC Github page. Intriguing Midterm and Endterm assignments will be given which will focus on the application part of concepts covered. Doubt sessions would be conducted on demand. The workshop will be followed by an expertâ€™s talk, to get you familiarized with the real-life implementation of controls theory in the ongoing world.

### Start Date
4th July 2021

### Duration
6 - 7 hours/week for 4 weeks (including assignments)

### Timeline
- Week 1: Introduction to a Controls Theory system and general mathematics using PID as an example.
- Week 2: Introduction to PID tuning, very basic python and simulating a PID-based Line Follower using stub code provided using the pygame library.
- Week 3: Introduction to MATLAB and Simulink, with a focus on the key functions required for implementing a controls system. Introduction to the problem statement of an inverted pendulum.
- Week 4: Working on assignment individually with doubt sessions. Showing some cool applications of controls theory.

### Course Completion
All the assignments must be solved and submitted. The assignments and solving process should be well-documented. These assignments would then be graded, and everyone clearing a cut-off would be given certificates.
